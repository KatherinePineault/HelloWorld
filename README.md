Learning to use GitHub once and for all

So, I've been coding in R for four months now, but still haven't learned how to use GitHub. Since it's my wish to become a better programmer and I got up this morning with a "It's a R kinda day" feeling, this is what I'm starting with. 

So, yeah. Hello, GitHub World!
